        <h2>Verse 1</h2>
        <p>I heard that you're settled down
          That you found a girl and you're married now
          I heard that your dreams came true
          Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
          Old friend, why are you so shy?
          Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light</p>
        <h2>Chorus</h2>
        <p>I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
          But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
          I had hoped you'd see my face
          And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you
          I wish nothing but the best for you, too
          Don't forget me, I beg
          I remember you said
          Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead</p>
        <h2>Verse 2</h2>
        <p>You know how the time flies
          Only yesterday was the time of our lives
          We were born and raised in a summer haze
          Bound by the surprise of our glory days</p>
        <h2>Chorus</h2>
        <p>I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
          But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
          I had hoped you'd see my face
          And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
          Never mind, I'll find someone like you
          I wish nothing but the best for you, too
          Don't forget me, I beg
          I remember you said
          Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead</p>
